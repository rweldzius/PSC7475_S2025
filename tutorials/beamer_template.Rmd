# Slide 1 title (tell us something about what we're about to see)

- Motivation
- Argument

---

# Slide 2 title (maybe something with your data here to further motivate your analysis)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
# echo = FALSE stops Rmarkdown from showing anything in this chunk when you knit 
# fig.height and fig.width might need to be adjusted
```

---

# Slide 3 title

- Here you can either include more motivating plots OR your hypothesis; if you include your hypothesis, think about including your statistical model equation as well (generic example below)

$$
\text{outcome}_i = \alpha + \beta_1 (\text{main predictor})_i + \beta_2 (\text{control var1})_i + \dots + \epsilon_i
$$

- $i$ indicates the units (e.g., countries, elections, etc.)

# Slide 4 title (show some initial results)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here you can include your statistical model. You'll want to output the results in a readable way. 
# Use this link to help with formatting these tables (see "regression table"); note that you'll have to use some new libraries (and note what they include at the beginning of the R chunk, e.g., "message = FALSE"): https://zief0002.github.io/book-8252/pretty-printing-tables-in-markdown.html
```

# Slide 5 title (concluding thoughts/next steps)

- Layout your next steps (the `\pause` after each line allows me to reveal each line with a click; no need to put this on your last line of text): \pause
  1. I need to look at the impact of a particular covariate/control, or add more controls \pause
  2. Check residuals \pause
  3. etc.
