# Why probability?

\pause

  - Probability quantifies chance variation or uncertainty in outcomes.\pause
    - It might rain or be sunny today, we don’t know which.\pause
  - We estimated a treatment effect of 7.2, but what if we reran history?\pause
    - Weather changes $\rightsquigarrow$ slightly different estimated effect.\pause
  - Statistical inference is a **thought experiment** about uncertainty.\pause
    - Imagine a world where the treatment effect were 0 in the population.\pause
    - What types of estimated effects would we see in this world by chance?\pause
  - Probability to the rescue!
  
---

# Sample spaces & events

\pause 

  - To formalize chance, we need to define the set of possible outcomes.\pause 
  - **Sample space**: $\Omega$ the set of possible outcomes.\pause 
  - **Event**: any subset of outcomes in the sample space
  
---

# Example: gambling

\pause 
  - A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards: \pause 
    - 13 rank cards: (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A) \pause 
    - in each of 4 suits: ($\clubsuit$,$\spadesuit$,$\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit}$,$\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit}$) \pause 
  - Hypothetical trial: pick a card, any card. \pause 
    - Uncertainty: we don’t know which card we’re going to get. \pause 
  - One possible outcome: picking a $4\clubsuit$ \pause 
  - Sample space: \vspace{-5pt}

\[  
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
2\clubsuit & 3\clubsuit & 4\clubsuit & 5\clubsuit & 6\clubsuit & 7\clubsuit & 8\clubsuit & 9\clubsuit & 10\clubsuit & J\clubsuit & Q\clubsuit & K\clubsuit & A\clubsuit \\
2\spadesuit & 3\spadesuit & 4\spadesuit & 5\spadesuit & 6\spadesuit & 7\spadesuit & 8\spadesuit & 9\spadesuit & 10\spadesuit & J\spadesuit & Q\spadesuit & K\spadesuit & A\spadesuit \\
2\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 3\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 4\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 5\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 6\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 7\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 8\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 9\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & 10\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & J\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & Q\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & K\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} & A\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit} \\
2\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 3\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 4\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 5\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 6\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 7\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 8\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 9\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & 10\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & J\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & Q\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & K\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} & A\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit} \\
\end{array}  
\]

  - An event: picking a Queen, {Q$\clubsuit$,Q$\spadesuit$,Q$\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit}$,Q$\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit}$}

# What is probability?

\pause

  - The probability  \( \mathbb{P}(A) \) represents how likely event $A$ occurs. \pause
  - If **all outcomes equally likely**, then:
  
$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{\text{number of elements in } A}{\text{number of elements in }\Omega}
$$

\pause 

  - Example: randomly draw 1 card: \pause 
    - probability of drawing 4$\clubsuit$: \pause $\frac{1}{52}$ \pause
    - probability of drawing any $\clubsuit$: \pause $\frac{13}{52}$ \pause
    
  - Same math, but different interpretations: \pause
    - **Frequentist**: \( \mathbb{P}() \) reflects relative frequency in a large number of trials. \pause 
    - **Bayesian**: \( \mathbb{P}() \) are subjective beliefs about outcomes. \pause
    
  - Not our fight $\rightsquigarrow$ stick to frequentism in this class
  
---

# Probability axioms

  - Probability quantifies how likely or unlikely events are. \pause
  - We'll define the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A) \) with three axioms:  \pause
  
  1. (Nonnegativity) \( \mathbb{P}(A) \) $\geq 0$ for every event $A$  \pause
  2. (Normalization) \( \mathbb{P}(\Omega) \) $= 1$   \pause
  3. (Addition Rule) If two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive 
  
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \text{ or } B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B).
$$

---

# Gambling 102

 \pause
 
  - What is \( \mathbb{P}(\text{Q card}) \) if a single card is randomly selected from a deck? \pause
    - "randomly selected" $\rightsquigarrow$ all cards have prob. 1/52 \pause
  - "4 card" event = {Q$\clubsuit$ \pause or Q$\spadesuit$ \pause or Q$\textcolor{red}{\heartsuit}$ \pause or Q$\textcolor{red}{\diamondsuit}$} \pause
  - Union of mutually exclusive events $\rightsquigarrow$  use addition rule \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ $\mathbb{P}(\text{Q card})$ $= \mathbb{P}(\text{Q}\clubsuit) +\mathbb{P}(\text{Q}\spadesuit) +\mathbb{P}(\textcolor{red}{\text{Q}\heartsuit}) +\mathbb{P}(\textcolor{red}{\text{Q}\diamondsuit})$ \pause $= \frac{4}{52}$

---

# Useful probability facts

  - Probability of the complement: \pause \( \mathbb{P}(\text{not }A) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A) \) \pause
    - Probability of **not** drawing a Queen is $1 - \frac{4}{52} = \frac{48}{52}$ \pause 
  - **General addition rule** for any events, $A$ and $B$: \vspace{-5pt}

$$
\mathbb{P}(A\text{ or }B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A\text{ and }B)
$$

\pause 

   - Probability of drawing Queen or $\spadesuit$ \pause
   - $\frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{52}$

# Conjunction fallacy

*Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.*

\pause 

  - What is more probable? \pause 
  
    1. Linda is a bank teller? 
    2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement? \pause
    
  - Famous example of the **conjunction fallacy** called the Linda
  problem \pause 
    - Majority of respondents chose 2, but this is impossible! \pause 
    
  - **Law of total probability** for any events $A$ and $B$: \pause

$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A\text{ and }B) + \mathbb{P}(A\text{ and not }B)
$$
\pause

\vspace{-20pt}

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{teller and feminist}) = \mathbb{P}(\text{teller}) - \mathbb{P}(\text{teller and not feminist})
$$

\pause 

  - What's the probability of randomly selecting a woman senator?
  \pause
  \vspace{-10pt}
  
$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{woman}) = \mathbb{P}(\text{woman and a Democrat}) + \mathbb{P}(\text{woman and not a Democrat}) 
$$

\pause  \vspace{-10pt}

# Conditional probability

  - If we know that $B$ has occurred, what is the probability of $A$? \pause
    - Conditioning our analysis on $B$ having occurred. \pause
  - Examples: \pause
    - Probability of two states going to war if they are both democracies? \pause
    - Probability of a judge issuing a pro-choice ruling if they have daughters? \pause
    - Probability of a coup in a country if it has a presidential system? \pause
  - Conditional probability extremely useful for data analysis.
  
---

# Conditional probability definition

\pause 

  - Definition: if $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$ then the **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$ is

\pause 

$$
\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \text{ and } B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$
\pause 

  - How often $A$ and $B$ occur divided by how often $B$ occurs. \pause
  
  - **WARNING!** $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ does **not**, in general, equal $\mathbb{P}(B|A)$ \pause
  
    - $\mathbb{P}(\text{smart}|\text{in QSS})$ is high \pause
    - $\mathbb{P}(\text{in QSS}|\text{smart})$ is low \pause
    - There are many many smart people who are not in this class (tell your friends)\pause
    
  - If all outcomes equally likely:
  
$$
\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\text{number of outcomes in both } A \text{ and } B)}{\text{number of outcomes in just } B}
$$

\pause

  - Choose one senator at random from this population \pause
  - What is the probability of choosing a woman? \pause
    - $\mathbb{P}(\text{Woman}) = \frac{26}{100} = 0.26$ \pause \vspace{5pt}
  - What is the probability of choosing a Republican who is a woman? \pause
    - $\mathbb{P}(\text{Woman | Rep.}) = \frac{10/100}{53/100} \approx 0.19$

# Conditional probability rules

  - Multiplication rule:
  
$$
\mathbb{P}(A\text{ and }B) = \mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(B|A)\mathbb{P}(A)
$$

  - Draw the names of two senators from a hat
  - What's the probability that we draw two women? \pause
  
    - Let $W_1$ and $W_2$ be the events that 1st and 2nd draws are women \pause 
    - We could make a list of all possible pairs to draw and count them... \pause
    - Or we could just use the multiplication rule:
    
$$
\mathbb{P}(W_1\text{ and }W_2) = \mathbb{P}(W_1)\mathbb{P}(W_2|W_1) 
$$

\pause   
  - **Law of total probability**:

\vspace{-5pt}  
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(A) & = \mathbb{P}(A \text{ and } B) + \mathbb{P}(A \text{ and not }B) \\  
& = \mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A |\text{ not }B)\mathbb{P}(\text{not }B)

# Independence

\pause 

  - Two events are **independent** if one occurring has no bearing on the probability of the other occurring. \pause 
    - Formally, $\mathbb{P}(A \text{ and }B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$ \pause 
  - If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $\mathbb{P}(A |B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$ \pause
    - Knowing $B$ occurred doesn't change the probability of A
    
---

# Sampling and independence

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling $>$ 1 with replacement: **independent draws** \pause 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Randomly draw 1 senator, note the name, then put it back in the hat. \pause 
    \item Shuffle, randomly draw 2nd senator, note the senator. \pause
    \item First draw doesn't affect second $\rightsquigarrow$ independence \pause
  \end{itemize}
  \item Sampling $>$ 1 without replacement: **dependent draws** \pause 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Randomly draw 1 senator, note the name, leave it out. \pause 
    \item Randomly draw 2nd senator from the remaining 99 senators. \pause
    \item First draw affects the probability of the second.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
