# What is causal effect?

**Factual** vs. **Counterfactual** \pause 

  * Does the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate? \pause 

    - Unemployment rate went up after the minimum wage increased
    - Would it have gone up if the minimum wage increase not occurred? \pause 
  
  * Does having girls affect a judge’s rulings in court? \pause 

    - A judge with a daughter gave a pro-choice ruling.
    - Would they have done that if had a son instead? \pause 

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference:** \pause 
    - Can never observe counterfactuals, must be inferred.

# Criminal record experiment

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/criminal_record.jpg}
\end{center}

  * Does having a criminal record affect job prospects?
  * Experimental setting:
    - Randomly assign 4 hired “confederates” (2 White, 2 Black) to apply to
different jobs in Milwaukee.
    - Men were matched on physical appearance, self-presentation, age, etc.
    - Confederates would alternate indicating they had a criminal record.
  * Outcome of interest: receiving a callback from a potential employer.

# A tale of two applications

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & Criminal Record  & Callback? \\ \hline
    Applicant 1 &  & \\ 
    Applicant 2 &  & \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

  * Did the first applicant not callback the applicant **because** they had a
criminal record?

---

# Notation and Jargon

  * **Unit** (indexed by $i$): job application for employer
  * **Treatment variable** $T_i$: criminal record or not
  * **Treatment group** (treated units): applications with criminal record
  * **Control group** (untreated units): applications without criminal record
  * **Outcome variable** $Y_i$: callback
 
\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 \\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if"
  * Would an employer treat criminal & noncriminal applicants differently?
  * Two **potential outcomes**:
    - $Y_i (1)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied as an ex-felon?
    - $Y_i (0)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied not as an ex-felon?
  * **Causal effect**: $Y_i (1)$ - $Y_i (0)$
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = 0 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record has no impact on callback
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = -1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record prevents callback
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = +1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record leads to callback
    
---

# Potential Outcomes

\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l  l  l}
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) & $Y_i (1)$ & $Y_i (0)$ \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 & 0 & ???\\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 & ??? & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**:
    - We only observe one of the two potential outcomes.
    - Observe $Y_i = Y_i (1)$ if $T_i = 1$ or $Y_i = Y_i (0)$ if $T_i = 0$
  * To infer causal effect, we need to infer the missing counterfactuals!
  
---

# How can we figure out counterfactuals?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/shining.jpg}
\end{center}

  * Find a similar unit! $\rightsquigarrow$ **matching**
    - Mill’s method of difference
  * Did applicant fail to get a job offer because of his criminal record?
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a non-ex-felon who is just like ex-felon applicant.
  * NJ increased the minimum wage. Causal effect on unemployment?
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a state similar to NJ that didn’t increase minimum wage.

# Imperfect matches

  \begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The problem: imperfect matches!
  \item Say we match $i$ (treated) and $j$ (control)
  \item \textbf{Selection Bias}: $Y_i (1) \neq Y_j (1)$
  \item Those who take treatment may be different that those who take control.
  \item How can we correct for that?

# Changing minds on gay marriage

  * Question: can we effectively persuade people to change their minds?
  * Hugely important question for political campaigns, companies, etc.
  * Psychological studies show it isn’t easy.
  * **Contact Hypothesis**: outgroup hostility diminished when people from different groups interact with one another.
  * Today we’ll explore this question the context of support for gay marriage and contact with a member of the LGBT community.
    - $Y_i =$ support for gay marriage (1) or not (0)
    - $T_i =$ contact with member of the LGBT community (1) or not (0)

---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if"
  * Would citizen $i$ have supported gay marriage if they had contact with a member of the LGBT community?
  * Two **potential outcomes**:
    - $Y_i(1)$: would $i$ have supported gay marriage if they **had** contact with a member of the LGBT community?
    - $Y_i(0)$: would $i$ have supported  gay marriage if they  **didn't have** contact with a member of the LGBT community?
    
  * **Causal effect** for citizen $i$: $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$
  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**: only one of the two potential outcomes is observable.

# Sigma notation

  * We will often refer to the **sample size** (number of units) as $n$. 
  * We often have $n$ measurements of some variable: $(Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n)$
  * We often want sums: how many in our sample support gay marriage?
  
  $$
  Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
  
  * Notation is a bit clunky, so we often use the **Sigma notation**:
  
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
  
  * $\sum_{i=1}^n$ means sum each value from $Y_1$ to $Y_n$
  
---

# Averages

  * The **sample average** or **sample mean** is simply the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  
  * Sigma notation allows us to write this in a compact way:
  
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
  $$
  
  * Suppose we surveyed 6 people and 3 supported gay marriage: 
  
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{6} (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0.5
  $$

# Quantity of interest

  * We want to estimate the average causal effects over all units: \vspace{-5pt}
  
  $$
  \text{Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) } = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \right)
  $$
  
  * Why can't we just calculate this quantity directly?
  * What we can estimate instead: \vspace{-5pt}
  
  $$
  \text{Difference in means } = \bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control}
  $$
    
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated}$: observed average outcome for treated group
  - $\bar{Y}_{control}$: observed average outcome for control group
  
  * When will the difference-in-means be a good estimate of the SATE?
  
---

# Randomized control trials (RCTs)

  * **Randomize control trial**: each unit's treatment assignment is determined by chance
    - e.g., flip a coin; draw read and blue chips from a hat; etc.
  * Randomization ensures **balance** between treatment and control group.
    - Treatment and control group are identical **on average**
    - Similar on both observable and unobservable characteristics.
  * Control group $\approx$ what would have happened to treatment group if they had taken control
    - $\bar{Y}_{control} \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i(0)$
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control} \approx$ SATE 
    
---

# Some potential problems with RCTs

  * **Placebo effects**:
    - Respondents will be affected by any intervention, even if they shouldn't have any effect
  * **Hawthorne effects**:
    - Respondents act differently just knowing that they are under study.
    
---

# Balance checking

  * Can we determine if randomization "worked"?
  * If it did, we shouldn't see large differences between treatment and control group on **pretreatment variable**
    - Pretreatment variable are those that are unaffected by treatment
  * We can check in the actual data for some pretreatment variable $X$
    - $\bar{X}_{treated}$: average value of variable for treated group
    - $\bar{X}_{control}$: average value of variable for control group
    - Under randomization, $\bar{X}_{treated} - \bar{X}_{control} \approx 0$
    
---

# Multiple treatments

  * Instead of 1 treatment, we might have multiple **treatment arms**:
    - Control condition
    - Treatment A
    - Treatment B
    - Treatment C, etc.
  * In this case, we will look at multiple comparisons:
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{control}$
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,B} - \bar{Y}_{control}$
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{treated,B}$
  * If treatment arms are randomly assigned, these differences will be good estimators for each causal contrast.
