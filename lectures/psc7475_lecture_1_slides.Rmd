# What is causal effect?

**Factual** vs. **Counterfactual** \pause 

  * Does the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate? \pause 

    - Unemployment rate went up after the minimum wage increased
    - Would it have gone up if the minimum wage increase not occurred? \pause 
  
  * Does having girls affect a judge’s rulings in court? \pause 

    - A judge with a daughter gave a pro-choice ruling.
    - Would they have done that if had a son instead? \pause 

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference:** \pause 
    - Can never observe counterfactuals, must be inferred.

# Criminal record experiment \pause 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/criminal_record.jpg}
\end{center}

  * Does having a criminal record affect job prospects? \pause 
  * Experimental setting:\pause 
    - Randomly assign 4 hired “confederates” (2 White, 2 Black) to apply to
different jobs in Milwaukee.\pause 
    - Men were matched on physical appearance, self-presentation, age, etc.\pause 
    - Confederates would alternate indicating they had a criminal record.\pause 
  * Outcome of interest: receiving a callback from a potential employer.\pause 
  
---  

# A tale of two applications \pause 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & Criminal Record  & Callback? \\ \hline
    Applicant 1 &  & \\ 
    Applicant 2 &  & \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center} \pause 

  * Did the first applicant not callback the applicant **because** they had a
criminal record?

---

# Notation and Jargon \pause 

  * **Unit** (indexed by $i$): job application for employer \pause 
  * **Treatment variable** $T_i$: criminal record or not \pause 
  * **Treatment group** (treated units): applications with criminal record \pause
  * **Control group** (untreated units): applications without criminal record \pause
  * **Outcome variable** $Y_i$: callback \pause
 
\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 \\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals \pause

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if" \pause
  * Would an employer treat criminal & noncriminal applicants differently? \pause
  * Two **potential outcomes**: \pause
    - $Y_i (1)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied as an ex-felon? \pause
    - $Y_i (0)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied not as an ex-felon? \pause
  * **Causal effect**: $Y_i (1)$ - $Y_i (0)$  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = 0 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record has no impact on callback  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = -1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record prevents callback  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = +1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record leads to callback  \pause
    
---

# Potential Outcomes  \pause

\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l  l  l}
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) & $Y_i (1)$ & $Y_i (0)$ \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 & 0 & ???\\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 & ??? & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}  \pause

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**:  \pause
    - We only observe one of the two potential outcomes.  \pause
    - Observe $Y_i = Y_i (1)$ if $T_i = 1$ or $Y_i = Y_i (0)$ if $T_i = 0$ \pause
  * To infer causal effect, we need to infer the missing counterfactuals! \pause
  
---

# How can we figure out counterfactuals? \pause

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/shining.jpg}
\end{center}

  * Find a similar unit! $\rightsquigarrow$ **matching**  \pause
    - Mill’s method of difference  \pause
  * Did applicant fail to get a job offer because of his criminal record? \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a non-ex-felon who is just like ex-felon applicant. \pause
  * NJ increased the minimum wage. Causal effect on unemployment? \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a state similar to NJ that didn’t increase minimum wage.

  \begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The problem: imperfect matches! \pause
  \item Say we match $i$ (treated) and $j$ (control) \pause
  \item \textbf{Selection Bias}: $Y_i (1) \neq Y_j (1)$  \pause
  \item Those who take treatment may be different that those who take control. \pause
  \item How can we correct for that? \pause

# Changing minds on gay marriage \pause

  * Question: can we effectively persuade people to change their minds? \pause
  * Hugely important question for political campaigns, companies, etc. \pause
  * Psychological studies show it isn’t easy. \pause
  * **Contact Hypothesis**: outgroup hostility diminished when people from different groups interact with one another. \pause
  * Today we’ll explore this question the context of support for gay marriage and contact with a member of the LGBT community. \pause
    - $Y_i =$ support for gay marriage (1) or not (0) \pause
    - $T_i =$ contact with member of the LGBT community (1) or not (0)

---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals \pause

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if" \pause
  * Would citizen $i$ have supported gay marriage if they had contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
  * Two **potential outcomes**: \pause
    - $Y_i(1)$: would $i$ have supported gay marriage if they **had** contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
    - $Y_i(0)$: would $i$ have supported  gay marriage if they  **didn't have** contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
    
  * **Causal effect** for citizen $i$: $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ \pause
  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**: only one of the two potential outcomes is observable.

---  

# Sigma notation \pause

  * We will often refer to the **sample size** (number of units) as $n$.  \pause
  * We often have $n$ measurements of some variable: $(Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n)$ \pause
  * We often want sums: how many in our sample support gay marriage? \pause
  
  $$
  Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
   \pause
  * Notation is a bit clunky, so we often use the **Sigma notation**:
   \pause
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
   \pause
  * $\sum_{i=1}^n$ means sum each value from $Y_1$ to $Y_n$
  
---

# Averages  \pause

  * The **sample average** or **sample mean** is simply the sum of all values divided by the number of values. \pause
  
  * Sigma notation allows us to write this in a compact way: \pause
  
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
  $$
   \pause
  * Suppose we surveyed 6 people and 3 supported gay marriage: 
   \pause
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{6} (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0.5
  $$
  
---

# Quantity of interest \pause

  * We want to estimate the average causal effects over all units: \vspace{-5pt} \pause
  
  $$
  \text{Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) } = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \right)
  $$
   \pause
  * Why can't we just calculate this quantity directly? \pause
  * What we can estimate instead: \vspace{-5pt} \pause
  
  $$
  \text{Difference in means } = \bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control}
  $$
     \pause
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated}$: observed average outcome for treated group
  - $\bar{Y}_{control}$: observed average outcome for control group
   \pause
  * When will the difference-in-means be a good estimate of the SATE?
  
---

# Randomized control trials (RCTs) \pause

  * **Randomize control trial**: each unit's treatment assignment is determined by chance \pause
    - e.g., flip a coin; draw read and blue chips from a hat; etc. \pause
  * Randomization ensures **balance** between treatment and control group. \pause
    - Treatment and control group are identical **on average** \pause
    - Similar on both observable and unobservable characteristics. \pause
  * Control group $\approx$ what would have happened to treatment group if they had taken control \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{control} \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i(0)$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control} \approx$ SATE 
    
---

# Some potential problems with RCTs \pause

  * **Placebo effects**: \pause
    - Respondents will be affected by any intervention, even if they shouldn't have any effect \pause
  * **Hawthorne effects**: \pause
    - Respondents act differently just knowing that they are under study.
    
---

# Balance checking \pause

  * Can we determine if randomization "worked"? \pause
  * If it did, we shouldn't see large differences between treatment and control group on **pretreatment variable** \pause
    - Pretreatment variable are those that are unaffected by treatment \pause
  * We can check in the actual data for some pretreatment variable $X$ \pause
    - $\bar{X}_{treated}$: average value of variable for treated group \pause
    - $\bar{X}_{control}$: average value of variable for control group \pause
    - Under randomization, $\bar{X}_{treated} - \bar{X}_{control} \approx 0$
    
---

# Multiple treatments \pause

  * Instead of 1 treatment, we might have multiple **treatment arms**: \pause
    - Control condition
    - Treatment A
    - Treatment B
    - Treatment C, etc.
  * In this case, we will look at multiple comparisons: \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{control}$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,B} - \bar{Y}_{control}$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{treated,B}$ \pause
  * If treatment arms are randomly assigned, these differences will be good estimators for each causal contrast.
